### Welcome to my Github Repo

Currently in the final quarter of my BSCS at Eastern Washington University. Looking to find work locally in Spokane, WA. On this Github page you can see some of the projects that I created or you can visit my web site at: [https://devync.com](https://devync.com).

### Interest

I enjoy programming in **Go** and **C** and using **GNU/Linux**. I also have programming experience with: **Java**, **PHP**, **Nodejs**, **PostgresSQL**, **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**. I would be happy to find a job working in systems programming or network programming, but most my experience is in full-stack development because of its accessibility to execute ideas but my interest would be in systems and network programming - back end development. It would also be nice to be able to start a business with computational systems if the opportunity arises.

I like to host and maintain my own servers such as my personal mail server, web servers and xmpp server.

### Explored areas with projects:

- OCR using Tesseract

- Network programming with sockets

- Federation with Activtypub protocol

- Image manipulation using ImageMagick

- Sound manipulation using FFmpeg
